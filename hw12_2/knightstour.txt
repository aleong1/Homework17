Latest Step by Step Algorithm for Knight's tour
1.	If there are no squares left (the tour is over), print solution
2.	Start by placing knight at top left corner
3.	For the number of knights on the board,
	a.	If possible, move knight to the space two down and one to the right (add it)
		i.	Then recursively place the knights down  with the rest of the spaces
	b.	If that wasn't possible choose remove that one and choose another one of the open spots a knight can move and go there (possibilities are the ones that go two down/up and over, the ones that go two across then up, and then the ones that go one down/up and over two)
		i.	Then recursively place the rest of the knights down
	c.	If the tours for a and b don't work out, that tour doesn't work
	d.	Otherwise, a solution is found.
4.	Return whether or not there was a solution (true/false) and if it was true, show what it was.
