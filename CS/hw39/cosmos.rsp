Episode 1 - "Standing Up in the Milky Way"

I don't think I fully understood how small we are in the universe until I watched this. The episode showed our cosmic address and how we're a small speck in the multiverse and how there are many more universes and galaxies there are in space. It's just hard to believe how much more is out there until you go there or actually see it. Also with the cosmic calendar and how all of what's recorded only happened in the last seconds of the year, then it really puts things into perspective. I don't think that makes anything less significant but kind of makes me think about how anything someone will do now have any effect later in time. It also makes me think about aliens and other life forms out there because if things existed for this long and there are many more universes out there, then why wouldn't there be anything else out there. The episode also made me feel bad for Bruno and how he had to die just for expressing his views even though it went against the views of the church. It just made me feel upset because he was punished and died horribly because he lived in a time where people weren't open minded and I wonder how faster things would've went if people accepted his views and worked with or against him to go further in proving things. I also thought that the way it was filmed and how we were "travelling" with Neil deGrasse Tyson in his spaceship made watching the show even more interesting.

Episode 3 - "When Knowledge Conquered Fear"

I thought it was cool and interesting how a comet in the sky can be interpreted with the same connotation in all parts of the world. To everyone or almost everyone a comet meant death and/or destruction in all parts of the world where people didn't even interact with each other yet. I also think that it was really amazing how Halley and Newton were able to explain the movement of the solar system in Newton's book that could be read my regular people. I think that this also showed such a change in people's views since the first episode where people didn't even want to hear Bruno's ideas and now people are openly reading and discussing Newton's and others' ideas and formulas, some people (Hooke) even taking credit for them when it wasn't his to begin with. I also think it's kind of disappointing how Halley achieved so many things in his life like finding out the distance to the sun and by helping Newton publish Principia but he's only really known for Halley's comet even though he did so much more. Overall, it's just really amazing how these people were able to make these formulas, observations, and accurately prove this information about the planets, sun, and stars when all they had to do this were their own minds and the instruments they have. It's just kind of crazy how they did all that without computers or machines that actually went into space.
