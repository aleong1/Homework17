/* This version of "Hello, World!" compared to Python and Racket is way a lot longer and seem to have a lot more words like public and void and static and main that are used to make "Hello, World!" compared to the few that Racket needs like "define" and "lambda" so overall, this seems more complex and complicated compared to Python.For similarities, all the functions do have the same format of defining a variable or a word in some type of bracket after the word you want to define.  */
