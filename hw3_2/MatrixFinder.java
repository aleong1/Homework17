/*
Consider an n x n 2D array of ints, wherein numbers increase across any row (L->R) and down any column...

e.g.,

| 1  3  5 |

| 3  7  8 |

| 5 12 15 |
... Given a target number returns the coordinates of the first occurence of the 
    target number if found
    If not found, (-1, -1) is returned

Algorithm: 
    1. Start with the top right corner
    2. Compare element with target
        a. if element == target, return coordinate
        b. if element < target, increase row by 1
        c  if element > target, decrease column by 1
    3. Repeat step 2 until coordinates are returned or element is out of bound
       in which case we return (-1, -1)
